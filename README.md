## Introduction

Weather Forecasting is a React-based web application that provides real-time weather forecasts for various locations. Weather conditions are continuously changing and present a formidable challenge due to their data-intensive, multidimensional, dynamic, and chaotic nature. This project aims to make accurate predictions using weather data and estimation techniques.

## Need of Weather Forecasting

Accurate weather forecast models are essential, especially in third-world countries, where agriculture heavily depends on weather conditions. Identifying weather trends that could disrupt the country's economy becomes a major concern. This React-based app addresses the need for reliable weather forecasts to assist decision-making in various sectors.

## Data Source: Open Weather Map API

The weather data displayed in our app is sourced from 'Open Weather Map,' a reputable and reliable data provider. Leveraging an API allows us to fetch real-time weather data efficiently, eliminating the need to create complex weather models from scratch. Using an API ensures access to accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts, improving the reliability of the predictions.
