# Weather Forecasting

Jan 2022 - Apr 2022

Weather simply refers to the condition of air on the earth at a given place and time.
It is a continuous, data-intensive, multidimensional, dynamic and chaotic process.
These properties make weather forecasting a formidable challenge.
Forecasting is the process of estimation in unknown situations from a data
The main problem here is to make an accurate prediction



[Need of Weather Forecasting:]

Accurate weather forecast models are important to third world countries, where the entire agriculture depends upon weather.
It is thus a major concern to identify any trends of weather, which would disrupt the economy of the country
The weather data that is displayed by our app is from a reputable source ‘Open Weather Map’.
We used ‘Open Weather Map’ source to fetch the weather data and display it.

[The benefit of using an API is:]

The code is much smaller and efficient compared to creating actual models that calculate the weather forecast for several days.
the API fetches the data from a reputable and reliable source so the chances of missing an accurate forecast are significantly low compared to creating a model by our self.
Using an API means you don't need a dataset for creating a forecasting model, which can be time consuming and limited to which area's weather you want to predict.
